                Santos Saúl Álvarez Barragán (born 18 July 1990), better known as
                "Canelo" Álvarez, is a Mexican professional boxer who has won multiple
                world championships in four weight classes, including light middleweight,
                middleweight, super middleweight, and light heavyweight, becoming the fourth
                Mexican boxer (after Érik Morales, Jorge Arce and Juan Manuel Márquez) to
                become a world champion in four weight classes. He is currently a unified super
                middleweight world champion, having held the WBA (Super), WBC, and
                Ring magazine titles since 2020.
                <br><br>
                Álvarez is known as an excellent counterpuncher,
                being able to exploit openings in his opponents'
                guards while avoiding punches with head and body movement.
                He is also known as a formidable body puncher.
                As of January 2021, Álvarez is ranked as the world's best active boxer,
                pound for pound, by BoxRec; The Ring; the Boxing Writers
                Association of America and the TBRB; and second by ESPN.
                He is also ranked as the world's best active super middleweight by BoxRec,
                The Ring, TBRB, and ESPN.
